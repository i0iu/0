> **Spoliers:**
<br>``` Gu Xiu was reborn back to the beginning of the century as a six-year-old elementary school student.
He watched his father, whose business venture had recently failed and was burdened with debt and entering a period of confusion.
"Dad, how about I show you a way forward?"
"Let's set a small goal first."
"Become the richest man!"
So, a middle-aged man began his life of counterattack, gradually carving his path to becoming the richest man.
But the moment he reached the altar, he discovered...
"Son, you're only in elementary school, how come you're already the richest man?"
Gu Xiu: Who says elementary school students can't become the richest man?
