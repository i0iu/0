Brief Summary:

  In the first year of martial arts, cracks appeared in the sky and earth, leading to the invasion of terrifying alien beasts. Over the next hundred years, human warriors began to rise, competing against these exotic beasts. However, by the two-hundred-year mark, humanity faced a decline, with their living space continuously encroached upon by the alien invaders.

  Three hundred years into this martial arts era, Lu Sheng crosses over and discovers he can log into the future in his dreams for ten thousand years. He learns that the basic alchemy techniques have been revised over ten thousand times, yielding effects thousands of times greater than those of the present. He also uncovers advancements in martial arts breathing methods and refining medicine formulas.

  Ultimately, after ten thousand years, humanity faces extinction, and the once-thriving martial arts civilization has no one to inherit its legacy. Lu Sheng stands as the last beacon of hope, embodying the only remaining fire of martial arts civilization.
