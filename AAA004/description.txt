Brief Summary:

  In the mystical realm of the Immortal Martial Arts Era, on the third day of the third month, the Qingyun Sect finally welcomes its eighth disciple, Ye Ping. Under the relentless efforts of the sect leader, the entire sect employs every trick in the book to impress Ye Ping and earn his respect. They boast of their unparalleled talents in swordsmanship, cultivation, alchemy, artifact forging, divination, formation techniques, treasure appraisal, and even claim to be the chosen ones of destiny.

  To maintain their facade of genius, the sect members resort to outrageous methods. A mere scratch with a sword is touted as a profound understanding of the ultimate sword intent. A simple pot is presented as a tool to concoct top-tier elixirs. Even a copper coin is used to predict the most extraordinary secrets of the universe. The hope is that Ye Ping will take his time to uncover the truth and linger within the sect a little longer.

  However, to everyone's astonishment, this seemingly ordinary new junior brother actually masters these skills!
